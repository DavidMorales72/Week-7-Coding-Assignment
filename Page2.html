    <h3>Why are these albums my top 3?</h3>
    <!--a small paragraph detailing why i like these albums-->
    <p>Each album brings a different vibe to the table and each of them can be correlated to a
        different feeling you may have. For example, 808s & Heartbreak is played when you're heartbroken. My Beautiful
        Dark Twisted Fantasy is played when you're feeling like you're really exited and Yeezus can be played when you just
        want loud music and strange sounds to play.
